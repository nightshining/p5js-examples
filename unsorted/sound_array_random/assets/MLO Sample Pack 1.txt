Hey there,

Here's a sample pack of my original elements from the first 10 Episodes of the MoShang Live Online Podcast.

Due to the 10MB upload limit, this sample pack has been greatly reduced in quality. Please download the high-quality 193MB version here:

These samples are all in stereo 24bit, 44.1kHz and mostly 4 bars long.

To help me find samples that go together quickly in the context of Ableton Live, I've marked samples e (EP), b (BASS), and s (SAX).

Thanks for using my loops and I hope you can find some inspiration amongst them!
